In this project, we propose a framework tailored for
navigation in row-crop fields by exploiting the regular crop-row structure present
in the fields. Our approach uses only the images from on-board cameras without
the need for performing explicit localization or maintaining a map of the field.
It allows the robot to follow the crop-rows accurately and handles the switch to
the next row seamlessly within the same framework. We implemented our approach
using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it in several simulated environments with different
shapes and sizes of field


## Features
 - Capble of autonmously navigating mobile robots through the row-crop fields.  
 - Executable on embeded controllers with limit processing power (Odroid, Raspberry Pi).
 - Compatible with ROS. 
 - Capble of having same performance on different mobile robot platforms.
 - Providing simulation environment to ease testing process.

## Dependencies
* c++11
* catkin
* opencv >= 2.4
* Eigen >= 3.3

Also a complete simulation package is provieded in [AgriBot Repository]() from [IPB](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/) including  simualted row-crop fields and robot needed to test the application.

## Build and Run *agribot_visualservoing* package
To launch the *agribot_visualservoing* simply follow these steps:
1. clone the package into your catkin_ws,
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/PRBonn/visual-crop-row-navigation.git
```
2. make sure dependencies are provieded,
3. build the package,
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make or catkin build
```
4. you need to have two cameras with these topics already running:
```
* /front/rgb/image_raw [image]
* /back/rgb/image_raw [image]
```
to stream image from webcams you can use [usb_cam](http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam)

5. launch package using:
```bash
$ roslaunch agribot_visualservoing visualservoing.launch
```
