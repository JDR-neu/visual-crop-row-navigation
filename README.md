By [IPB](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/), University of Bonn.

This is a robot navigation framework tailored for navigating in row-crop fields by exploiting the regular crop-row structure present in the fields. It uses only the images from on-board cameras without the need for performing explicit localization or maintaining a map of the field. It allows the robot to follow the crop-rows accurately and handles the switch to the next row seamlessly within the same framework.

This implementation uses C++ and ROS and has been tested in different environments both in simulation and in real world and on diverse robotic platforms.

Check out the video of our robot following this approach to navigate on a test row-crop field [here](https://youtu.be/0qg6n4sshHk) or by clicking on the image below.

## Features
 - Autonomous robot navigation in row-crop fields without requiring maps.
 - Runs on embedded controllers with limit processing power (Odroid, Raspberry Pi).
 - Compatible with ROS.
 - Same performance on different mobile robotic platforms.
 - Includes simulation environment to ease the testing process.

## Requirements
 - Mobile robot equipped with two cameras mounted respectively looking to the front and to the back of the robot below.

## Dependencies
* c++11
* catkin
* opencv >= 2.4
* Eigen >= 3.3

A complete simulation package is provided in [agribot_robot]() repository including  simulated row-crop fields and robot for testing the navigation framework.

## How to build and run

1. Clone the package into your *catkin_ws*
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/PRBonn/visual-crop-row-navigation.git
```
2. Build the package
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build agribot_visualservoing
```
3. Run ROS driver to stream images from the robot's cameras, for example using [usb_cam](http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam)
<!-- ```
* /front/rgb/image_raw [image]
* /back/rgb/image_raw [image]
``` -->
4. Run visual servoing navigation
```bash
roslaunch agribot_visualservoing visualservoing.launch
```
