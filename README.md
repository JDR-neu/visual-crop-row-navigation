# visual-crop-row-navigation
Visual-servoing based navigation for monitoring row-crop fields

---
In this paper, we propose a framework tailored for
navigation in row-crop fields by exploiting the regular crop-row structure present
in the fields. Our approach uses only the images from on-board cameras without
the need for performing explicit localization or maintaining a map of the field.
It allows the robot to follow the crop-rows accurately and handles the switch to
the next row seamlessly within the same framework. We implemented our approach
using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it in several simulated environments with different
shapes and sizes of field
